**TotK Guesser** is a game inspired by **GeoGuessr**, but instead of guessing locations on Earth, you guess locations in **Hyrule**! Instead of exploring the Earth, you‚Äôll be placed at random spots in Hyrule, and you need to figure out where you are. The game includes different areas like the **Sky Islands**, the **Surface**, and the hidden **Depths**.

## üåç How It Works

TotK Guesser is inspired by the popular game **GeoGuessr**. In **TotK Guesser**, you are placed at random locations within Hyrule and need to guess your location based on the environment around you. This includes areas from the **Sky Islands**, the **Surface**, and the mysterious **Depths**. Your task is to guess your coordinates, and your answer is compared to the correct location to earn points!

## üéÆ Features

- **Multiple Map Layers:** Play on the **Surface**, explore the **Sky Islands**, or venture into the **Depths** of Hyrule!
- **Interactive Map:** Zoom in and move around the map to explore different areas.
- **Difficulty Levels:** Choose between **Easy**, **Medium**, and **Hard** to match your skill level.
- **Highscore System:** Collect points and compare your results with other players.

## ‚ú® Inspiration

The idea for TotK Guesser came from expanding the project [hyruleguessr](https://hyruleguessr.com). Originally inspired by **GeoGuessr**, I wanted to enhance the game by adding the **Depths** and **Sky Islands** of Hyrule ‚Äì two intriguing and mysterious parts of the game world that offer a deeper exploration experience. 

In **TotK Guesser**, you now have the opportunity to explore these areas and prove your knowledge of Hyrule.
